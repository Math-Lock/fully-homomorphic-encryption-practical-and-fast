# fully-homomorphic-encryption-practical-and-fast
The first one in the World fast, secure and practical Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) cryptosystem. So far, here I place only demo samples, since all the algorithms and implementation are proprietary, our web-site - https://www.math-lock.com

We are Israeli based small startup, which developed absolutely inuque, revolutionary FHE cryptosystem, which is the only one in the World is being built on developed from scratch new math. fundamentals, compare to all the rest existing schemes based on lattices, like CKKS, BGV, BFV etc and respectively all existing libraries such as PALISADE, SEAL, HELib, TFHE etc

Our solution isn't just a scheme, but whole cryptosystem, which gives hight performance, security and capability to be used as a fully practical solution, being many orders of magnitude faster, than any PALISADE, SEAL etc libs.

Also, this is the only one solution where Homomorphism is an inherent property and not just ugly construction to make none-homomorphic things to be homomorphic. Our solution is the only one which doesn't use noise to provide security, while our secirty is based on few very complicate math. problems.
